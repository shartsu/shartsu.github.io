I have finished my master thesis defense at [Graduate School of SIE, University of Tsukuba](http://www.sie.tsukuba.ac.jp/english/).

For the defense, participants must contain the whole research project during that degree term. 

Since I have conducted several project in this two years, the 20 minutes presentation time was too short!

I needed to summarize below projects in one presentation:
* The psychophysical and online EEG experiment of the fbBCI (full-body spacial vibrotactile BCI) paradigm
* The classification accuracy improvement of the fbBCI EEG experiment under off-line condition
* Convolutional Neural Network application for the analysis of somatosensory evoked potentials acquired in the fbBCI paradigm
Note that each of them could be described in 20 minutes presentations! 

So I tried to concise essential informations of each project as much as possible, which allowed me to end up the presentation on time.

Consequently I have almost done my work at the master's term, but still I have a big thing to do ... going to USA again to present my new research project ;)
