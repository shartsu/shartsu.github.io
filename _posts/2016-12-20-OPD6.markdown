I gave a short research presentation at [OPEN PAAK DAY #6](https://mtl.recruit.co.jp/events/open-paak-day-6/) of [TECH LAB PAAK](http://techlabpaak.com/) in Shibuya.

The private organization is actually run by Japanese company [Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd.](http://www.recruit-rgf.com/) in order to grow the startup company in Japan. I've participated a support program as the project member for this six months. 

This event was the end-up presentation day of the six months program. I wasn't an entrepreneur but a researcher, though, many other participants were interested in our research project. 

I hope this experience would be fruitful in the future carrier ;)
