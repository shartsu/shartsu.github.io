My first time visiting for South Korea was to attend [Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association, 2016 Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA ASC 2016)](http://www.apsipa2016.org/main.do). 

The Jeju island where the conference was taken place is located just adjacent to Kyusyu district in our country Japan. I was actually excited to visit the beautiful island famous for the sightseeings.

I gave my research presentation at the "Recent topics in neural signal processing and brain-machine/computer interfaces session". My presentation title was "**Tactile Brain-Computer Interface Using Classification of P300 Responses Evoked by Full Body Spatial Vibrotactile Stimuli**". That was the summary of my research project building the full-body vibrotactile P300-based interface.

Since the session was specialized in BCI, I got a lot of specific feedbacks regarding the experiment setups as well as the classification results. I also met Prof. Higashi and Prof. Tanaka who were previous colleague of my supervisor Prof. Rutkowski for the first time and exchanged the hopeful discussions for the future researches.

I also would like to thank [HARA research foundation](http://www.hara-rf.jp/) which funded me to participate such a brilliant conference. I have to appreciate all the supports allowing me to continue my research project m(__)m
