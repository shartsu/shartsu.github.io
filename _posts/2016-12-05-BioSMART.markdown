title: Research Presentation at "BioSMART Conference 2016 @ UAE"

I've been to UAE for attending [IEEE BioSMART Conference 2016](http://www.conf-biosmart.org/) from 3 to 9 on December. 

My first visiting to Dubai was in winter, though its maximum temperature was around 30 degrees Celsius. The concept of the conference was **Biomedical** x **Technology** x **SMART**. Actually there were numerous biomedical conference in the world, but this conference specialized in the smart technology. The BCI has considered as one of the new category.

The research topic I delivered in the presentation was "**Full–body Tactile P300–based Brain–computer Interface Accuracy Refinement**". We applied several signal processing settings (decimation factors and epoch averagings) and several machine learning algorithms (LDA, linear SVM and non-linear SVM) to our BCI settings, then compared the classification accuracies using the fbBCI datasets.

At the conference, attendees from all over the world were not only researchers, but also a company employees. So all we exchanged the "SMART" discussions in terms of both academic and business side. We as well had the great feedbacks after the presentations.

I had been nominated as a candidate of the student BEST paper award:
[BioSMART BEST paper award candidates](http://www.conf-biosmart.org/biosmart-competition). Unfortunately, though, I wasn't able to get an award, but it was surely my great experience through the graduate student life.
